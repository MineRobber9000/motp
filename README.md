# **M**ineRobber's **O**verpowered **T**ools **P**ack

A datapack for Minecraft 1.13+ that allows for some overpowered combos. Goals:

 - [ ] Unbreakable tools
    - [x] Crafting bedrock
      - [x] Need to balance (use diamond?)
 - [ ] Overpowered enchantments (call Supercharged?) - basically just normal enchants but over the level you normally get them
    - [ ] how to obtain?
 - [ ] Document how it's done
    - [ ] maybe make a Python library for pack making? idk
